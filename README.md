# Binary-search-tree

BTS project

## Description
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript. A binary search tree is a data structure that facilitates fast lookup, addition, and deletion of items. Each node in the tree has at most two children referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Features
- Insert nodes
- Delete nodes
- Search for a node
- In-order traversal
- Pre-order traversal
- Post-order traversal
